# Minimal Neovim

- Hello, I wanted to share a minimal neovim config for JS developers.

- Capabilities:

  - lsp + auto-complete + snippets
  - formatting + format on save
  - telescope == fzf

- The keymappings are heavily opinionated.
- I made it using:

  - <https://github.com/brainfucksec/neovim-lua>
  - <https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch/>

- Besides the plugin requirements, the lsp is setup to work with neovim 0.8
- You have to initialize npm or yarn for tssserver to work.

- _I will add more details_
